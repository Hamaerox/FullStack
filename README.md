This is a Full MERN Stack website. It wasd deisgned around the concept of video games. Designed with React, Javascript, Express, MongoDB, HTML and CSS. During this project I became intrigued with Keyframes so there are a few of them in the project. This project was not centered around functionality and not design. Pulls data from multiple APIs including a custom built API servered up to hold the comments attached to individual games.
